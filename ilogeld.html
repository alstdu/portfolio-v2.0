                        <p>The prototype for this project was created in my UX/UI 1 course. I chose to do an ELD because
                            it was outside the
                            norm of what other people were creating, and my partner is a software developer in ELD
                            solutions. It was
                            very helpful to have someone who was knowledgable about the industry while creating this
                            project! During
                            the testing phase, my step-dad (who is a truck driver) was among those who tested my
                            solution as well.

                    <div class="artifact-details">
                        <p>The main issues I had were in the testing phase. As I illustrate in my report, the first
                            issue I
                            encountered was that mostly every person tested my prototype on mobile. Maze, unfortunately,
                            is
                            not
                            very mobile friendly. I let my testers know to use desktop if possible, but it’s just more
                            convenient to test on mobile if that’s how you’re being sent the test. One big downside to
                            this
                            is
                            that the user doesn’t know they need to scroll down to see everything, and hotspots do not
                            appear if
                            they mis-click. In my next test, I made sure to put some more thought into my starting
                            screens
                            to
                            make it more like a process flow versus making them start from the beginning every time with
                            no
                            guidance.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The second issue I encountered was more of an oversight, which is that I wasn't aware that my
                            classmates would be the main ones testing my prototype. Originally, I had people in mind who
                            were already familiar with the software to avoid the need to explain how to use it. It's
                            reasonable to say my classmates have likely never even heard of an ELD prior to this. I did,
                            however; end up sending the test to said people along with my classmates.</p>

                        <p>After the course was completed, our instructor gave us feedback for improvements in the
                            future. Knowing I wanted to use this as a portfolio piece, I implemented the solutions
                            provided. These included improved icons, easier navigation elements, and considering color
                            and 'disabled' button colors.</p>
