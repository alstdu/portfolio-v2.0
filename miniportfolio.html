                        <p>The thinking behind this project was to create a mini portfolio that could
                            be accessed from social media "link in bios". It would be totally mobile
                            optimized, contain a few featured projects, and have important
                            contact links. Similar to what Linktr.ee does, but totally custom.

                        <p>The YouTube tutorial to the left was the inspsiration for this project. For the first bit, I
                            followed the tutorial step by step to get a feel for looking at the traditional CSS and
                            converting to Tailwind classes. While this isn't the point of Tailwind, it ultimately did
                            help me memorize the naming patterns used by Tailwind pretty quickly. Around the middle of
                            the tutorial, I was good to go... But not without solving some major issues first.</p>

                        <p>The first major issue I ran into was improper importing of Tailwind. I was using all the
                            correct commands, but for some reason Node Modules weren't being created.
                            I later found out that the reason for this was because it was installing, not in my project
                            folder, but in my User folder on my computer. After dragging that file into my project, most
                            issues fixed itself.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>While everything was working overall, some of the styles weren't showing up. I even tried
                            downloading Tailwind IntelliSense to make sure I was inputting the classes correctly. I
                            found that they weren't even being recognized.
                            For about 3 hours, I researched troubleshooting for this issue. I asked Chat GPT, looked on
                            Reddit, Stack Overflow, read the Tailwind docs over and over and over - yet nothing I tried
                            was working.
                            I eventually found someone was having the same issue in the Tailwind community forums. They
                            said to make sure that I was using 'extend' inside of my theme configuration.
                            In hindsight that seems really obvious, but I couldn't find good documentation for that in
                            the docs. Some places it looked optional, and I couldn't find an explaination of what it was
                            even for.
                            I have since figured out that my custom styles were overwriting the default styles. By
                            adding it into the 'extend', it allowed both styles to exist.
