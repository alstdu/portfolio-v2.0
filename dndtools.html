                        <p>I knew I wanted to create a D&D project as soon as I got the opportunity. After being familiarized
                            with Chicken Dinner 5e, I decided that I could make something similar and more interactive.

                        <p><span class="meta-title"> Find APIs &amp; Plugins </span></p>
                        <p>Step 1 in my process involved finding APIs and plugins I wanted to use. 
                            The API I chose was the <a href="https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/">dnd5e API</a>, specifically targeting the spells list endpoint.
                            After that, I looked for plugins that would enhance the user experience. One of my main goals was to have a 3D dice 
                            rolling page. Typically the ones you would see are 2d with an animation, but it doesn't mimic the feeling of real dice to me.
                            I ended up finding a really awesome plugin by <a href="https://fantasticdice.games/">3DDice</a> which uses ammoJS and BabylonJS
                            for the dice models and physics. In addition to the spells list information, I wanted to be able to sort the list and search for 
                            specific spells. For this I used <a href="https://listjs.com/">List.js</a>. I also used Overlay Scrollbars for a custom scrollbar to
                            fit the feel, and <a href="https://sarcadass.github.io/granim.js/">Granim</a> for colorful interactions with the ui.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="meta-title">Coding the Table</span></p>
                        <p>After planning out how I wanted to use my new toolset, I began with developing a simple table that would be used for the spells list.
                            This involved a lot of documentation reading and research on accessibility. I wanted to make sure that the table would be correctly 
                            parsed by screen readers and that the use of keyboard interactions would be possible. This meant ensuring the correct HTML structure
                            and the use of HTML5 tags, along side using aria properties. Once the table was properly set up, I began adding the <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/2cb623615481709f286cefd93d793cce18c4e344">expansion panels</a>.
                            These panels contained all the necessary information about the spell from the dnd5e API. At this point I also began using JavaScript to <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/be9f02adc3cbad1c75053dd3a47e488a1fbf73d8">create DOM elements</a> if certain information was present, and to toggle
                            the aria-expanded property from true to false depending on if the panel was open or not. I added the Granim plugin and used the <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/1c47f198952d8d92d67e55ab044832f7e5bc1cc9">Granim instances</a> feature to
                            change the set of colors depending on what 'school' of magic the spell was from.

                        <p><span class="meta-title">The Point Buy Calculator</span></p>
                        <p>The point buy page was mostly math and getting everything to update together, so the big challenge here was 
                            figuring out exactly what was happening when you added points or took them away. It took a while to plan out, but eventually
                            <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/c6aa07ec5a8cf6ae1d4fc1f0fe7b1d9da283dbae">I got there</a>. I had to 
                            put in place the min and max values for points as well as add a reset button in case you wanted to start over. The fun part was
                            <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/2b8b34f615d2ef2090e6f2db99d1d9fa8c0775fd">adding more Granim</a> instances
                            for when you're under, over, and at your point budget.

                        <p><span class="meta-title">The Dice</span></p>
                        <p>For the 3D dice plugin, I used Webpack to add the dependency to my project. <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/145f7881da1ccc2adaeb7f9abc6c81970c05df7b">Here</a> you can see
                            how I did the initial set up. Next, I had to set up a way to actually roll the dice, so I used JavaScript to set up an event listener connected to a button.
                            I then did this same thing for the d20, d10, d12, d8, d6, and d4. This was greatly optimized thanks to the use of the 3D dice plugin. I was able to 
                            create <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/76640db2e808517c745898fef31a335c9963526f">multiple instances</a> for each of the dice.

                        <p>At first, each of the pages were only working until roughly tablet size. I wanted to make sure that I was able to deliver
                            a quality assignment over increasing the scope too much. So I knew this was something I wanted to eventually work on.
                            As of now, each of the pages are <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/16f983e2a7a93cdb3159836088fc4d15dfc332b6">mobile friendly</a>.

                        <p>I really wanted to add the ability to add up the total from rolling multiple dice at the same time. At the time of submission, only one dice
                            of each kind was able to be rolled at a time. So I added this functionality which can be seen <a href="https://github.com/alstdu/dugo-dnd-tools/commit/fc328973fef56789347dd72e2d1c783b3e9bbc26">here</a>.
